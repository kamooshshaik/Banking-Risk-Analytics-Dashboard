# Banking Risk Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **risk analytics in banking and financial services**, leveraging **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **interactive dashboards** to understand customer behavior, loan repayment capability, and overall banking performance.  

The goal is to provide insights that help banks **minimize the risk of lending** and make informed decisions about approving or rejecting loan applications.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
  - Created new calculated columns such as `Engagement Timeframe`, `Engagement Days`, `Income Band`, and `Processing Fees`.  
  - Applied data binning for income categories.  
  - Standardized multiple client and banking-related tables using primary and foreign keys.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Analyzed client profiles, loan details, deposits, and credit balances.  
  - Used Python (Jupyter Notebook) for **EDA and preprocessing**.  

- **Power BI Dashboard**  
  - Designed **interactive dashboards** to visualize KPIs such as:
    - Total Clients  
    - Total Loan  
    - Bank Loan  
    - Business Lending  
    - Deposits (Bank, Saving, Checking, Foreign Currency)  
    - Credit Card Balances  
    - Processing Fees  
  - Created **Loan Analysis, Deposit Analysis, and Summary Dashboards**.
